 * @notice Interface for oracles that resolve binary prediction markets
 * @dev Oracles are responsible for providing YES/NO resolutions to markets.
 *      They are the source of truth for determining which outcome occurred.
 *      
 *      Implementation requirements:
 *      - Must return a binary resolution (YES = true, NO = false)
 *      - Should revert if market is unknown or unresolved
 *      - Resolution should be immutable once set
 *      
 *      Example implementations:
 *      - Chainlink: Use price feeds to resolve price-based markets
 *      - UMA: Use optimistic oracle for general purpose resolution
 *      - Governance: Use token voting for subjective questions
 *      - Multisig: Use trusted parties for specific events
